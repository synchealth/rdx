# @rdx-js/rdx

Reactive Dialogs (RDX) implementation for digital conversations using Remark. Forked from @tinialabs/tdx and @mdx-js/mdx with updated transpiler for whendo runtime

While the `rdx` specification is very similar to markdown and similar formats such as `mdx`, a different extension is used as the code in any code blocks may be executed. In addition the execution order of formats such as `mdx` are linear (a single document) where as a `rdx` module may be executed as an adaptive dialog over the series of many days. The specification also includes yaml front matter by default.
